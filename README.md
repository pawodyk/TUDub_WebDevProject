## INSTRUCTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to put into practice the skills that you have learned around deigning a *well-structured website* through different page mark-up techniques and styling using HTML5 and CSS3.

This assignment requires you to choose a website subject based on a choice of themes and design a set of web pages for it. Every student must design a different website so the subject of your website __must be approved__ by the lecturer in advance. Please speak to your lecturer about your project choice before starting work on it.

The website subject should be based on one of the following themes:

1. Hobby
2. Sports Team
3. Local Company
4. Charity
5. TV Series
6. Music Artist

The website should showcase the vast majority of, if not all of, the HTML and CSS web development skills which have been discussed in lectures 1-7. For this project the only content you may use from other sources are images which must to be clearly and correctly referenced in the documentation (and if necessary, the copyright author could be contacted to request commercial use of the image, etc.). See appendix A for details on how to reference correctly.

***All text in your website must have been written BY YOU. Do not copy and paste text from any website/source into your HTML pages.*** There does not have to be a lot of text in your website – a paragraph or two on each page could be fine.

As well as the actual website code, you are required to submit documentation of the CSS style rules as well as documentation on the HTML code as needed.
 
### Deliverables

The main deliverables for this assignment is the website folder and the documentation. The website folder should contain the following:

* **index.html** (i.e. home page)
* **/images** (i.e. folder subdirectory for all the website images)
* **/css** (i.e. folder subdirectory for the website CSS file(s))
* At least **10 more HTML pages** including, for example, the following as appropriate (choose appropriate filenames):
    * Site map (all website pages listed, showing site structure, as links to all pages) – see Appendix B
    * Contact page (phone number, email address, postal address, etc.)
    * Characters pages/players pages/staff pages/members pages/etc.
        * Should have a main staff/members/etc. page and then separate pages about at least two items on the main page
    * Product/Merchandise page
        * An a-z list of products with at least 6 items
        * Clickable image links which provide more details on at least 3 of the items

The documentation to go with the website files should be a __single__ word document and include the following:

* Cover page
* Discussion of any noticeable/unusual HTML use and an explanation why it was used
* Discussion of __all__ CSS style rules (i.e. what they do, what elements they are being applied to, why they were choosing, etc.)
* Conclusions of website design process and potential future work
* Full referencing of any sources used (i.e. full source of images, etc.)

### Additional Information

General requirements for the site include:

* Use the project to demonstrate your knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3
* Site should exhibit strong design, user-friendly navigation, clear and consistent layout, and professional appearance
* Site should exhibit proper use of background, font, and colors
* Site should be free of grammatical/spelling errors
* All images must have alt tags, be well placed, and working correctly
* Each page must have an appropriate title
* Each page must have a consistent navigation menu containing functional links to all other pages
* Each page must include copyright and “last updated” information
* All code should be well spaced and indented
* All styling should be done using an external style sheet(s)
* All code should be validated using the validator for CSS and HTML 5
* Demonstrate the use of entities
* Demonstrate the use of ordered, unordered, nested and definition lists
* All links should be correctly hyperlinked and working
* Include links that demonstrate the usage of internal links, external links, image links, email links, and bookmark links
* The site map must be a nested list which links with all other pages

#### About Media Files

Please observe the following about the use of media in your website:

* Only use still images, and only use HTML and CSS
    * No audio, no videos, no Flash, no Silverlight, no animated GIFs
    * There is no requirement for any technologies such as Javascript or JQuery or PHP etc.
        * no marks will be gained by the use of such technologies
        * However, links to videos are fine if you wish to add Youtube type links
    * less is more …
        * a simple but effective website will score better than a hard to understand / messy complicated website – so keep a **non-technical website visitor** in mind at all times…

#### Website Usability Testing Advice

It is always a good idea to ask other people, who are not familiar with your project, to test your website. They should provide feedback on the usability (i.e. colours, fonts, navigation) and the content of your website. You may implement changes to your webpages based on the feedback.

### Submission Details

The assignment is due on the **3rd April @ 11.55pm**. The submission should include the zipped website folder (as outlined above and including all HTML/CSS/Image files) and the documentation zipped together in a folder named the student’s student ID number (e.g. B00002456) and submitted via Moodle.

### Marking Scheme

The following is the indicative marking scheme for the assignment (out of 100 marks):

| Criteria | Mark |
| :--- | :---: |
| Folder/file structure, Contents & naming quality | 5 |
| Correctness | 5 |
| Completeness | 5 |
| Code quality - HTML | 10 |
| Code quality - CSS | 10 |
| Usability | 10 |
| Page/site content quality & Declaration of sources | 5 |
| HTML range of techniques | 15 |
| CSS range of techniques | 10 |
| Technical challenge demonstrated | 10 |
| Documentation | 15 |
| Use of forbidden techniques (deduct marks) | 15- 30 |

The assignment must be performed **individually** – this is not a group assignment.

Each submission must be original work as plagiarism will result in a zero mark (0%). 
**There will be a 5% penalty (out of the total 40% CA going for the assignment) for each day the assignment is late**. In other words, a submission between 11.56pm on the 2nd April and 11.55pm on the 3rd April will only be marked out of 35% CA, a submission between 11.56pm on the 3rd April and 11.55pm on the 4th April will be marked out of 30% CA and so on.
There is no penalty for submitting early.
